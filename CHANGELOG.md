# Change Log
Important changes to Oh My Fish are recorded here for each release.


## [5] - 2017-02-05
### Added
- Replace package database with new, independently installed package repository system. Packages are no longer stored in the framework repository tree. Instead packages are stored in a package repository, a Git repo with a list of available packages. Multiple sources are supported, with the old database contents moved to the [packages-main] repository. [#427]

### Bugs fixed
- Fix function paths when switching themes during runtime without a reload. Previously if a theme had a `functions` directory, it was only added to the function path at init time and not removed when switching themes. [#479] [#485]
- Ignore ".git" suffix on theme URLs in the Themes document generator. [#472]
- Documentation fixes and improvements. [#481]

## [4] - 2017-01-04
### Added
- The Doctor (`omf doctor`) now prints some additional info for ease in troubleshooting common problems. [#456]

- Compatibility fixes for Fish 2.4.0. [#459]
- If there is an existing theme set up, do not replace it when installing Oh My Fish for the first time. [#274] [#435]
- Do not use Fish color variables for the default theme. This helps ensure the theme looks correct under any version of Fish. [#440] [#446]

## [3] - 2016-10-20
- Key bindings are now fully supported in user config and in plugins. Bindings should be placed in a `key_bindings.fish` script and will be loaded automatically. [#368] [#355] [#334]
- Init process completely rewritten to improve performance and correctness. Using `on_{plugin}` events for plugin initialization is now deprecated and will eventually be removed. `init.fish` scripts will be sourced directly and are passed the variables `$path`, `$package`, and `$bundle`. [#343] [#335]
- Revamped _hooks_ system that allows plugins to register scripts to be executed on certain events. Hooks are now located in `{plugin}/hooks` (except for `init` and `key_bindings`) and are regular Fish scripts named after the target hook event. Adds support for `install` and `update` hooks. See the [package docs](docs/en-US/Packages.md) for details. [#286]
- Completely new interactive installer written for correctness that no longer overwrites any existing usr config files. Also supports offline installs. [#399] [#385] [#381] [#361] [#330]
- The core framework updater now respects release versions and by default upgrades between tagged releases only. Run `omf channel dev` to receive updates from `master`. [#293]
- Fixes for Fish 2.3.* compatibility. [#327] [#325]
- `omf update` now returns the correct output and exit status. [#394] [#365]
- Fix errors shown for the default theme when in a Git detached head. [#366]
- Update templates for new plugins. [#403] [#333]
- Documentation fixes and improvements. [#380] [#378] [#373] [#371] [#370] [#369] [#354] [#345]
