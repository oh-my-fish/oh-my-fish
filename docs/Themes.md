# agnoster
#### agnoster

A fish theme optimized for people who use:

* Solarized
* Git
* Mercurial (requires 'hg prompt')
* SVN
* Unicode-compatible fonts and terminals (I use iTerm2 + Menlo)

For Mac users, I highly recommend iTerm 2 + Solarized Dark

![agnoster theme](https://f.cloud.github.com/assets/1765209/255379/452c668e-8c0b-11e2-8a8e-d1d13e57d15f.png)


###### Characteristics

* If the previous command failed (✘)
* User @ Hostname (if user is not DEFAULT_USER, which can then be set in your profile)
* Git/HG/SVN status
* Branch () or detached head (➦)
* Current branch / SHA1 in detached head state
* Dirty working directory (±, color change)
* Working directory
* Elevated (root) privileges (⚡)
* Current virtualenv (Python)
You will probably want to disable the default virtualenv prompt. Add to your [`init.fish`](https://github.com/oh-my-fish/oh-my-fish#dotfiles):
`set --export VIRTUAL_ENV_DISABLE_PROMPT 1`
* Indicate vi mode. (If you've set `fish_vi_mode` in your config and don't like the ugly left prompt indicator you can solve this by replacing it with `set -g fish_key_bindings fish_vi_key_bindings` and then removing the `if set -q __fish_vi_mode` check at the bottom of the `fish_right_prompt.fish`)

# bobthefish
### bobthefish

`bobthefish` is a Powerline-style, Git-aware [fish][THEMES-NAMESPACE-bobthefish-fish] theme optimized for awesome.

[![](https://img.shields.io/badge/Framework-Oh My Fish-blue.svg?style=flat)](https://github.com/oh-my-fish/oh-my-fish) ![](https://img.shields.io/cocoapods/l/AFNetworking.svg) [![Join the chat at https://gitter.im/oh-my-fish/oh-my-fish](https://badges.gitter.im/Join%20Chat.svg)](https://gitter.im/oh-my-fish/oh-my-fish?utm_source=badge&utm_medium=badge&utm_campaign=pr-badge&utm_content=badge)

![bobthefish][THEMES-NAMESPACE-bobthefish-screenshot]

##### Installation

Be sure to have Oh My Fish installed. Then just:

    omf install bobthefish

You will probably need a [Powerline-patched font][THEMES-NAMESPACE-bobthefish-patching] for this to work.
[I recommend picking one of these][THEMES-NAMESPACE-bobthefish-fonts].

This theme is based loosely on [agnoster][THEMES-NAMESPACE-bobthefish-agnoster].

##### Features

 * A helpful, but not too distracting, greeting.
 * A subtle timestamp hanging out off to the right.
 * Powerline-style visual hotness.
 * More colors than you know what to do with.
 * An abbreviated path which doesn't abbreviate the name of the current project.
 * All the things you need to know about Git in a glance.
 * Visual indication that you can't write to the current directory.

##### The Prompt

 * Flags:
     * Previous command failed (**`!`**)
     * Background jobs (**`%`**)
     * You currently have superpowers (**`$`**)
 * Current vi mode
     * _You'll need to `set -g theme_display_vi yes` to enable_
 * `User@Host` (unless you're the default user)
 * Current RVM or rbenv (Ruby) version
 * Current virtualenv (Python) version
     * _If you use virtualenv, you will probably need to disable the default virtualenv prompt, since it doesn't play nice with fish: `set -x VIRTUAL_ENV_DISABLE_PROMPT 1`_
 * Abbreviated parent directory
 * Current directory, or Git or Mercurial project name
 * Current project's repo branch (<img width="16" alt="branch-glyph" src="https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/53660/8768360/53ee9b58-2e32-11e5-9977-cee0063936fa.png"> master) or detached head (`➦` d0dfd9b)
 * Git or Mercurial status, via colors and flags:
     * Dirty working directory (**`*`**)
     * Untracked files (**`…`**)
     * Staged changes (**`~`**)
     * Stashed changes (**`$`**)
     * Unpulled commits (**`-`**)
     * Unpushed commits (**`+`**)
     * Unpulled _and_ unpushed commits (**`±`**)
     * _Note that not all of these have been implemented for hg yet :)_
 * Abbreviated project-relative path

##### Configuration

You can override some of the following default options in your `config.fish`:

```fish
set -g theme_display_git no
set -g theme_display_git_untracked no
set -g theme_display_git_ahead_verbose yes
set -g theme_display_vagrant yes
set -g theme_display_hg yes
set -g theme_display_virtualenv no
set -g theme_display_ruby no
set -g theme_display_user yes
set -g theme_display_vi yes
set -g theme_display_vi_hide_mode default
set -g theme_title_display_process yes
set -g theme_title_display_path no
set -g theme_title_use_abbreviated_path no
set -g theme_date_format "+%a %H:%M"
set -g theme_avoid_ambiguous_glyphs yes
set -g default_user your_normal_user
```

**Title options**

- `theme_title_display_process`. By default theme doesn't show current process name in terminal title. If you want to show it, just set to `yes`.
- `theme_title_display_path`. Use `no` to hide current working directory from title.
- `theme_title_use_abbreviated_path`. Default is `yes`. This means your home directory will be displayed as `~` and `/usr/local` as `/u/local`. Set it to `no` if you prefer full paths in title.

**Prompt options**
- `theme_display_ruby`. Use `no` to completely hide all information about Ruby version. By default Ruby version displayed if there is the difference from default settings.
- `theme_display_vagrant`. This feature is disabled by default, use `yes` to display Vagrant status in your prompt. Please note, only VirtualBox provider is supported.

# budspencer
### Budspencer theme

A theme for nerds, makes fish even more powerful. It's equipped with a hell of a
lot of nice functions and key bindings to speed up your workflow.

The philosophy behind budspencer theme:

* Delimit the prompt lines clearly to the output.
* Produce output only if it contains relevant information.
* Show useful notifications within the prompt.
* Equip the prompt with toggle commands in order to change its style
  interactively.
* Store sessions in order to make frequently used commands quickly accessible.
* Make navigation within the directory tree as easy as possible using
  bookmarks and a directory history without duplicates.
* Make histories quickly accessible with menus.
* Don't stress your eyes. Use different colors in dark and bright environments.

#### Demonstration video

[![video][THEMES-NAMESPACE-budspencer-screenshot]](http://vimeo.com/105546618)

#### Requirements

You need an up-to-date fish shell version from [github][fish-git] or a
[nightly build][fish-nightly].

Non standard tools:

* xsel
* wmctrl
* git
* [taskwarrior][THEMES-NAMESPACE-budspencer-taskwarrior] (optional)
* [remind][THEMES-NAMESPACE-budspencer-remind] (optional)

##### Note for OS X users

The theme uses advanced `sed` and `expr` features. The OS X tools have
restricted functionality.

Try `expr` from `coreutils` package if you see `expr: syntax error` in
budspencer prompt.

Execute `brew install --with-default-names gnu-sed` if there are
`Array index out of bounds` messages in your prompt.

#### Configuration

##### General configuration

The theme behaves similar to vim's airline/powerline plugins. Thus, it needs a
[powerline font][THEMES-NAMESPACE-budspencer-font].
It's also crucial to have vi mode enabled. Thus, execute
```
set -U fish_key_bindings fish_vi_key_bindings
```
before enabling the theme.

##### Colors

Redefine `$budspencer_colors` with the `set` command in order to change the
colors of the prompt.

Example:
```
set budspencer_colors 000000 333333 666666 ffffff ffff00 ff6600 ff0000 ff0033 3300ff 0000ff 00ffff
00ff00
```
will result in a prompt like this:
![color replace example][THEMES-NAMESPACE-budspencer-colors]

Two color schemes for bright and dark environments are predefined. You can
enable them with `day` and `night`, respectively.

##### Command history
Commands that shouldn't appear in the command history are defined by a universal
list `$budspencer_nocmdhist`. Default:
```
set -U budspencer_nocmdhist c d ll ls m s
```

##### Disable/reenable greeting

Disable:
```
set -U budspencer_nogreeting
```

Reenable:
```
set -e budspencer_nogreeting
```

#### Outer prompt segments

- Vi mode is indicated by color of outer segments, cursor color also changes
  if terminal supports it:
    * blue: NORMAL mode
    * yellow: INSERT mode
    * magenta: VISUAL mode

#### Left prompt segments

- Prompt line number
- Git repository information
- Status symbols
    * ✻: keep track of this shell session, can be toggled with `#` to show the number of
       the session within the sessions list
    * ⌘: present working directory is in bookmark list, can be toggled with `#` to
        show the number of the bookmark
    * V: vi is parent process
    * R: [ranger][THEMES-NAMESPACE-budspencer-ranger] is parent process
    * ⚙: there are background jobs, can be toggled with `#` to show the amount of
        background jobs
    * : no write permissions in present working directory
    * ⚔: there are tasks scheduled for this week, can be toggled with `#` to
        show the amount of weekly tasks
    * ⚑: there are appointments for today, can be toggled with `#` to
        show the amount of appointments
    * ✔: last command succeeded, can be toggled with `#` to show the status value
    * ✘: last command failed, can be toggled with `#` to show the status value
    * ⚡: superuser indicator
- Present working directory
- Active Python [virtual environment](https://virtualenv.pypa.io/en/latest/). Requires [Virtual Fish](https://github.com/adambrenecki/virtualfish/)

#### Right prompt segments

- Last command's duration time
- Git status symbols:
    * ↑: git repository is ahead origin
    * ↓: git repository is behind origin
    * +: changes have been added to git index
    * –: files have been deleted in work tree
    * ✱: files have been modified in work tree
    * →: files have been renamed in git index
    * ═: there are unmerged commits
    * ●: there are untracked (new) files
    * ✭: there are stashed commits

#### Toggle prompt segments

The following shortcuts need vi-mode:
- Style of "present working directory"-segment can be toggled in NORMAL and in
  VISUAL mode with space bar
    * styles implemented:
        - `short` (shows username, short hostname and truncated path; recommended in
          most cases)
        - `long` (shows username, full hostname and full path; useful for copy-paste
          in ssh connections)
        - `none` (shows nothing except small delimiter; useful for small terminals)
        - If prompt is toggled with `#`, the IP address is shown instead of the
          hostname.
    * configurable by universal list `$budspencer_pwdstyle` (if not set, defaults to
      `short long none`); note that changes to `$budspencer_pwdstyle` keep persistant as it's
      a universal variable.

![pwd style][THEMES-NAMESPACE-budspencer-pwdstyle]

- Style of symbols can be toggled in NORMAL and in VISUAL mode with `#`
    * styles implemented:
        - `symbols` (shows status symbols)
        - `numbers` (shows numbers instead of symbols in left prompt as well as amount of changes in
          right git prompt)

Note, the format is _username@hostname:pathname_. Thus, you can cut
the whole string with your mouse and paste it into `ssh` commands.

#### Quickly navigate in history of working directories

The function `d` drops down a menu showing the history as enumerated list. Unlike
fish's builtin `dirh`, `d` does not show any duplicates. Enter a number to jump
to a directory within the list.

![dir menu][THEMES-NAMESPACE-budspencer-dirmenu]

The following shortcuts need vi-mode:
- Press `H` in NORMAL mode to change present working directory to previous
  working directory in history.
- Press `L` in NORMAL mode to change present working directory to next working
  directory in history.

#### Quickly navigate in command history

The function `c` drops down a menu showing the command history as enumerated list similarly to
the `d` function. Selections are also pasted into the X clipboard. It's possible
to load a command of a former prompt by giving the prompt line number as
argument.

#### Bookmarks

A bookmark can be created with `mark`. It can be removed with `unmark`.
Bookmarks are universal and thus persistant.
A new shell automatically changes working directory on startup to newest bookmark.
`m` is a function that drops down a menu showing the bookmarks as enumerated list
equivalently to `d`.

The following shortcuts need vi mode:
- Create a bookmark for present working directory with `m` in NORMAL mode.
- Remove a bookmark for present working directory with `M` in NORMAL mode.

#### Edit commandline with your favorite editor

The function `edit-commandline` let you edit the commandline with your editor.
It makes the commandline as powerful as your editor. If `$EDITOR` is not set,
vi is used.

The following shortcut needs vi mode:
- Type `.` in NORMAL mode to edit commandline in editor.

#### Sessions

Shell session can be stored with `s <session name>`. If a session with `session
name` already exists, the session with this name will be attached. If a session with
`session name` is already active within another terminal, this terminal will be
focussed.

A list of available sessions can be shown with `s`.

A session can be erased with `s -e <session name>`.

Type `s -d` to detach current session.

#### Set window title

Just type `wt <title>`.

#### Ring the bell in order to set the urgency hint flag

If you have configured your terminal application to use the visual bell, your
window manager will tell you when a job running in your shell has finished. You
don't need to check manually whether it's done.

If you have still activated the acoustic bell, you probably hate that feature.
Switch it off in that case:
```
set -U budspencer_nobell
```

#### TODO

- vi REPLACE mode, as soon as REPLACE mode is implemented within fish

#### Feedback

Give me feedback if you ...
* ... have ideas how I could improve budspencer.
* ... have problems with budspencer. 
* ... have questions concerning budspencer.

A theme for the 70s, makes fish even more powerful. It's equipped with a hell
of a lot of nice functions and key bindings to speed up your workflow.

The philosophy behind dangerous theme:

* Delimit the prompt lines clearly to the output.
* Produce output only if it contains relevant information.
* Show useful notifications within the prompt.
* Equip the prompt with toggle commands in order to change its style
  interactively.
* Store sessions in order to make frequently used commands quickly accessible.
* Make navigation within the directory tree as easy as possible using
  bookmarks and a directory history without duplicates.
* Make histories quickly accessible with menus.
* Don't stress your eyes. Use different colors in dark and bright environments.

![screenshot][THEMES-NAMESPACE-dangerous-screenshot]

#### Requirements

You need an up-to-date fish shell version from [github][fish-git] or a
[nightly build][fish-nightly].

Non standard tools:

* xsel
* wmctrl
* git
* [taskwarrior][THEMES-NAMESPACE-dangerous-taskwarrior] (optional)
* [remind][THEMES-NAMESPACE-dangerous-remind] (optional)

#### Configuration

##### General configuration

It's crucial to have vi mode enabled. Thus, execute
```
set -U fish_key_bindings fish_vi_key_bindings
```
before enabling the theme.

##### Colors

Redefine `$dangerous_colors` with the `set` command in order to change the
colors of the prompt.

Example:
```
set dangerous_colors 000000 333333 666666 ffffff ffff00 ff6600 ff0000 ff0033 3300ff 0000ff 00ffff
00ff00
```

Two color schemes for bright and dark environments are predefined. You can
enable them with `day` and `night`, respectively.

##### Command history
Commands that shouldn't appear in the command history are defined by a universal
list `$dangerous_nocmdhist`. Default:
```
set -U dangerous_nocmdhist c d ll ls m s
```

##### Disable/reenable greeting

Disable:
```
set -U dangerous_nogreeting
```

Reenable:
```
set -e dangerous_nogreeting
```

#### Outer prompt segments

- Vi mode is indicated by color of outer segments, cursor color also changes
  if terminal supports it:
    * blue: NORMAL mode
    * yellow: INSERT mode
    * magenta: VISUAL mode

#### Left prompt segments

- Prompt line number
- Git repository information
- Status symbols
    * ✻: keep track of this shell session, can be toggled with `#` to show the number of
       the session within the sessions list
    * ⌘: present working directory is in bookmark list, can be toggled with `#` to
        show the number of the bookmark
    * V: vi is parent process
    * R: [ranger][THEMES-NAMESPACE-dangerous-ranger] is parent process
    * ⚙: there are background jobs, can be toggled with `#` to show the amount of
        background jobs
    * : no write permissions in present working directory
    * ⚔: there are tasks scheduled for this week, can be toggled with `#` to
        show the amount of weekly tasks
    * ⚑: there are appointments for today, can be toggled with `#` to
        show the amount of appointments
    * ✔: last command succeeded, can be toggled with `#` to show the status value
    * ✘: last command failed, can be toggled with `#` to show the status value
    * ⚡: superuser indicator
- Present working directory

#### Right prompt segments

- Last command's duration time
- Git status symbols:
    * ↑: git repository is ahead origin
    * ↓: git repository is behind origin
    * +: changes have been added to git index
    * –: files have been deleted in work tree
    * ✱: files have been modified in work tree
    * →: files have been renamed in git index
    * ═: there are unmerged commits
    * ●: there are untracked (new) files
    * ✭: there are stashed commits

#### Toggle prompt segments

The following shortcuts need vi-mode:
- Style of segments can be toggled in NORMAL and in VISUAL mode with space bar
    * styles implemented for present working directory segment:
        - `short` (shows username, short hostname and truncated path; recommended in
          most cases)
        - `long` (shows username, full hostname and full path; useful for copy-paste
          in ssh connections)
        - `none` (shows nothing except small delimiter; useful for small terminals)
        - If prompt is toggled with `#`, the IP address is shown instead of the
          hostname.
    * configurable by universal list `$dangerous_pwdstyle` (if not set, defaults to
      `short long none`); note that changes to `$dangerous_pwdstyle` keep persistant as it's
      a universal variable.
    * The other segments are hidden in case `$pwd_style` is `none`.

- Style of symbols can be toggled in NORMAL and in VISUAL mode with `#`
    * styles implemented:
        - `symbols` (shows status symbols)
        - `numbers` (shows numbers instead of symbols in left prompt as well as amount of changes in
          right git prompt)

Note, the format is _username@hostname:pathname_. Thus, you can cut
the whole string with your mouse and paste it into `ssh` commands.

#### Quickly navigate in history of working directories

The function `d` drops down a menu showing the history as enumerated list. Unlike
fish's builtin `dirh`, `d` does not show any duplicates. Enter a number to jump
to a directory within the list.

The following shortcuts need vi-mode:
- Press `H` in NORMAL mode to change present working directory to previous
  working directory in history.
- Press `L` in NORMAL mode to change present working directory to next working
  directory in history.

#### Quickly navigate in command history

The function `c` drops down a menu showing the command history as enumerated list similarly to
the `d` function. Selections are also pasted into the X clipboard. It's possible
to load a command of a former prompt by giving the prompt line number as
argument.

#### Bookmarks

A bookmark can be created with `mark`. It can be removed with `unmark`.
Bookmarks are universal and thus persistant.
A new shell automatically changes working directory on startup to newest bookmark.
`m` is a function that drops down a menu showing the bookmarks as enumerated list
equivalently to `d`.

The following shortcuts need vi mode:
- Create a bookmark for present working directory with `m` in NORMAL mode.
- Remove a bookmark for present working directory with `M` in NORMAL mode.

#### Edit commandline with your favorite editor

The function `edit-commandline` lets you edit the commandline with your editor.
It makes the commandline as powerful as your editor. If `$EDITOR` is not set,
vi is used.

The following shortcut needs vi mode:
- Type `.` in NORMAL mode to edit commandline in editor.

#### Sessions

Shell session can be stored with `s <session name>`. If a session with `session
name` already exists, the session with this name will be attached. If a session with
`session name` is already active within another terminal, this terminal will be
focussed.

A list of available sessions can be shown with `s`.

A session can be erased with `s -e <session name>`.

Type `s -d` to detach current session.

#### Set window title

Just type `wt <title>`.

#### TODO

- vi REPLACE mode, as soon as REPLACE mode is implemented within fish

> nelsonjchen theme for [Oh My Fish][omf-link]. Based on re5et in Oh-My-Zsh.

#### Install

```fish
$ omf u nelsonjchen
```

#### Features and Differences

* Pretty colors
* Two line prompt
* Git Prompt using off-the-shelf fish functions
  * Note that the symbology, colors, and features are more than the `zsh` version and they don't match up 1-to-1. For example, checking out a tag will show the tag name in `fish` but the re5et version in `zsh` will simply show the commit ID. This was one such freebie amongst many I just left in while porting since the `fish` script was giving it to me for free anyway. It is still pretty close though.
* Red user prompt if `root`
* 12 hour clock
  * re5et: 24 hour clock
* MM DD YY date format
  * re5et: YY MM DD date format
* Title Setting to the `prompt_pwd` function in fish for screen, tmux, and non-terminal multiplexer.
  * This is derived from [@chgu82837's theme](https://github.com/chgu82837/theme-PastFish/blob/39af8e2885e308501bb0afa9dedab193a8722cfe/fish_prompt.fish#L82-L90)

#### Omissions from the re5et version

* Trimming down the working directory display only works on `~`. The original re5et prompt would also trim based on the current environment variables set. For example, if you had the environment variable `FOO` set to `/usr/local` and you did `cd /usr/local`, you would see `$FOO/` in the prompt as the current working directory. I'm not sure how I would get this working. `fish` does appear to have a condensation function but it goes beyond simple environment variable replacement and I can't figure out how to turn it off.

# ocean
#### ocean

A fish theme with ocean in mind.


![Preview](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/129920/3533761/4702cc78-07d9-11e4-826f-e9f797e4bfa8.png)


Unicode-compatible fonts and terminals is required.

I would recommend iTerm2 + Solarized Dark for Mac users.

This theme is based loosely on [agnoster](https://gist.github.com/agnoster/3712874)

###### Characteristics
* Show a radioactive symbol (☢) when gain the root privileges (It's dangerous!)
* Current python virtualenv (if applicable)
* The anchor (⚓) turns red if the previous command failed
* Full path of current working directory
* Show the Git branch and dirty state (if applicable)
* Show **User@Hostname** if user is not the default user. Set the following two lines in your config.fish to turn on this feature:
    
    ```fish
    set -g theme display_user yes
    set -g default_user your_default_username
    ```

###### Troubleshooting in iTerm
If you see a colored anchor icon instead of the white one, this is because your system font is lacking the anchor icon, and iTerm defaults to the Apple Emoji Font. To get the right icon, either add it to your current font, or chose a powerline font that has it (like Meslo for Powerline, available in https://github.com/powerline/fonts), and select it for your Non-ASCII font.

# syl20bnr
### syl20bnr theme

A semi-compact oh-my-fish theme with [nice support for git](#git).

The theme has been tested on `Ubuntu 14.04 (Trusty)` and `Mac OS X 10.10 (Yosemite)`.
It is also compatible with [Cygwin with the appropriate packages](#cygwin-compatibility).

**Table of Contents**  *generated with [DocToc](http://doctoc.herokuapp.com/)*

- [Segments](#segments)
	- [pwd: Compact current working directory](#pwd-compact-current-working-directory)
		- [Examples](#examples)
	- [git](#git)
		- [Examples](#examples-1)
	- [vi-mode](#vi-mode)
	- [end](#end)
	- [where](#where)
- [Functions](#functions)
- [Mac compatibility](#mac-compatibility)
- [Cygwin compatibility](#cygwin-compatibility)

#### Segments

##### pwd: Compact current working directory

The `pwd` segment format is `X:P(N)` where:
- `X` is either `home` or `/`
- `P` is the current working path base name (name of the current directory)
- `N` is the depth of the path starting from `X`

If the `pwd` is `home` or `/` then the prompt format is simplified to `home`
and `/` respectively without the current directory and depth.

###### Examples

In home directory:
![home](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/syl20bnr/oh-my-fish-theme-syl20bnr/master/screenshots/prompt_fish-syl20bnr-home2.png)

Inside a directory in home:
![inside_home](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/syl20bnr/oh-my-fish-theme-syl20bnr/master/screenshots/prompt_fish-syl20bnr-inside-home.png)

Outside the home directory:
![outside_home](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/syl20bnr/oh-my-fish-theme-syl20bnr/master/screenshots/prompt_fish-syl20bnr-outside-home.png)

##### git

If the current directory is a [git][THEMES-NAMESPACE-syl20bnr-git] repository then the `pwd` segment is
replaced by the `git` segment (I should know where I am).

The `git` segment format is `X:YI@Z:P(N)` where:
- `X` is `git`
- `Y` is the current branch name
- `I` is some information about the current repository state
- `Z` is the name of the repository
- `P` is the current working path basename (name of the current directory)
If `P` = `Z` then `P(N)` is not displayed
- `N` is the depth of the path starting from base directory of the repository

The displayed information `I` is:
- Unpushed commits are indicated with an up arrow like this `[↑1]`
- Unmerged fetched commits are indicated with a down arrow like this `[↓1]`

**Note:** The dirtiness of the current branch is indicated by its color:
- red: it is dirty
- green: it is up to date

**Note:** The unmerged commits count appears only if the changes in the
upstream branch as been fetched.

###### Examples

Dirty (changes not committed):

##### vi-mode

This segment display the current `vi-mode` if the fish native vi mode or
the oh-my-fish vi-mode plugin is used.
See the `[n]` in the previous screenshots.

##### end

The color of the end of the prompt depends on the `$status` value of the
last executed command. It is `green` or `red` depending on the success or
failure of the last command.

Since I often use [ranger][THEMES-NAMESPACE-syl20bnr-ranger] and its `shift+s` key binding to bring
a new child shell session, there is a discreet indicator when the parent
process of the current shell is a `ranger` process: the end of the prompt
is written twice (ie: `>>` instead of just `>`).
With this indicator I quickly see if I can `ctrl+d` to end the current shell
process and go back to the parent `ranger` process.

##### where

The `where` segment format is `X@Y` where:
- `X` is the user name
- `Y` is the host name

This segment is displayed in the right prompt.

#### Functions

Some functions come with the theme:
- `toggle_right_prompt` will... toggle the right prompt! (alias: `trp`)

#### Mac compatibility

In order to make this theme work correctly with all the features make sure to
install the following packages via MacPorts or Homebrew:
-`pstree` (used in ranger detection)

#### Cygwin compatibility

In order to make this theme work on [Cygwin][THEMES-NAMESPACE-syl20bnr-cygwin], make sure to install the following
packages:
- `bc` for `math` fish function
- `psmisc` for `pstree` (used in ranger detection)
- `git` if you want to use the `git` segment.

### tomita

A minimal, aesthetically pleasing fish theme.

> Note: Make sure you're using a Unicode-enabled terminal and font.

#### Prompt

    <abbreviated path> (<current git branch>) [<vi mode>] ⋊>

* Working directory
* Current git branch
* vi mode (requires fish 2.2+)

> This theme includes a custom vi mode indicator which is built into `fish_prompt`. If you'd like to use vi mode, I recommend adding the following lines to your config.fish:
>
>     # note: this erases the default fish_mode_prompt, which adds a vi mode
>     # indicator to the left of your prompt
>     function fish_mode_prompt; end
>
>     # turn on vi mode when the shell starts
>     fish_vi_mode
