## Installation

You can get started right away with the default setup by running this in your terminal:

```fish
curl -L https://get.oh-my.fish | fish
```

This will download the installer script and start the installation. Alternatively, you can download the installer and customize your install:

```fish
curl -L https://get.oh-my.fish > install
fish install --path=~/.local/share/omf --config=~/.config/omf
```

You can verify the integrity of the downloaded installer by verifying the script against [this checksum](bin/install.sha256):

```
92ca680df48640e744b361d376194c5f5f8d6b4f1ac775d22417a0d8a8108767  install
```

You can also install Oh My Fish with Git or with an offline source tarball downloaded from the [releases page][releases]:

```fish
# with git
$ git clone https://github.com/oh-my-fish/oh-my-fish
$ cd oh-my-fish
$ bin/install --offline
# with a tarball
$ curl -L https://get.oh-my.fish > install
$ fish install --offline=omf.tar.gz
```

Run `install --help` for a complete list of install options you can customize.

## Getting Started

Oh My Fish includes a small utility `omf` to fetch and install new packages and themes.

#### `omf update` _`[omf]`_ _`[<package>...]`_

Update Oh My Fish, all package repositories, and all installed packages.

- When called without arguments, update core and all installed packages.
- You can choose to update only the core, by running `omf update omf`.
- For selective package update, list only the names of packages you wish to
  update. You may still include "omf" in the list to update the core as well.

#### `omf install` _`[<name>|<url>]`_

Install one _or more_ packages.

- You can install packages directly by URL via `omf install URL`
- When called without arguments, install missing packages from [bundle](#dotfiles).

#### `omf repositories` _`[list|add|remove]`_

Manage user-installed package repositories. Package repositories are where packages come from used by commands like `omf install`. By default the [official repository](https://github.com/oh-my-fish/packages-main) is always installed and available.

#### `omf list`

List installed packages.

#### `omf theme` _`<theme>`_

Apply a theme. To list available themes, type `omf theme`. You can also [preview available themes](./docs/Themes.md) before installing.

#### `omf remove` _`<name>`_

Remove a theme or package.

> Packages can use uninstall hooks, so custom cleanup of resources can be done when uninstalling it. See [Uninstall](/docs/en-US/Packages.md#uninstall) for more information.

#### `omf reload`

Reload Oh My Fish and all plugins by using `exec` to replace current shell process with a brand new.

> This command tries to be as safe as possible, mitigating side-effects caused by `exec` and preventing the reload in case of background processes.

#### `omf new pkg | theme` _`<name>`_

Scaffold out a new package or theme.

> This creates a new directory under `$OMF_CONFIG/{pkg | themes}/` with a template.

#### `omf search` _`-t|--theme / -p|--package`_ _`<name>`_

Searches Oh My Fish's database for a given package, theme or both. It also supports fuzzy search, so if you are not sure of the name you can simply `omf search simple`.

#### `omf channel`

Gets or changes the update channel.

Two channels are available by default: the `stable` channel provides stable updates with the latest tagged version of Oh My Fish, and `dev` which provides the latest changes under development. The update channel currently set determines what version `omf update` will upgrade to.

#### `omf doctor`

Use to troubleshoot before [opening an issue][omf-issues-new].

#### `omf destroy`

Uninstall Oh My Fish.

## Advanced

Oh My Fish installer places its startup code in your fish config file (`~/.config/fish/config.fish`).

### Startup

Every time you open a new shell, the startup code initializes Oh My Fish installation path and the _config_ path (`~/.config/omf` by default), sourcing the [`init.fish`](init.fish) script afterwards, which autoloads packages, themes and your custom init files.

For more information check the [FAQ](docs/en-US/FAQ.md#what-does-oh-my-fish-do-exactly).

### Dotfiles

The `$OMF_CONFIG` directory represents the user state of Oh My Fish. It is the perfect
candidate for being added to your dotfiles and/or checked out to version control. There are five important files:

- __`theme`__ - The current theme
- __`bundle`__ - List of currently installed packages/themes
- __`init.fish`__ - Custom script sourced after shell start
- __`before.init.fish`__ - Custom script sourced before shell start
- __`key_bindings.fish`__ - Custom key bindings where you can use the `bind` command freely

It's highly recommended that your custom startup commands go into `init.fish` file instead of `~/.config/fish/config.fish`, as this allows you to keep the whole `$OMF_CONFIG` directory under version control.

If you need startup commands to be run *before* Oh My Fish begins loading plugins, place them in `before.init.fish` instead. If you're unsure, it is usually best to put things in `init.fish`.

#### Setting variables in `init.fish`

One of the most common startup commands used in `init.fish` is variables definition. Quite likely, such variables need to be available in any shell session. To achieve this, define them globally. For example:

```fish
# Golang developers might need this one
set -xg GOPATH $HOME/gocode

# Python developers otherwise
set -xg PYTHONDONTWRITEBYTECODE 1
```

#### About the bundle

Every time a package/theme is installed or removed, the `bundle` file is updated. You can also edit it manually and run `omf install` afterwards to satisfy the changes. Please note that while packages/themes added to the bundle get automatically installed, a package/theme removed from bundle isn't removed from user installation.

## Creating Packages

Oh My Fish uses an advanced and well defined plugin architecture to ease plugin development, including init/uninstall hooks, function and completion autoloading. [See the packages documentation](docs/en-US/Packages.md) for more details.
