# Install

```fish
curl -L github.com/oh-my-fish/oh-my-fish/raw/master/bin/install | sh
omf help
```

Or _download_ and run it yourself:

```fish
curl -L github.com/oh-my-fish/oh-my-fish/raw/master/bin/install > install
chmod +x install
./install
```

# Getting Started

Oh My Fish includes a small utility `omf` to fetch and install new packages and themes.

#### `omf update`

Update the framework and installed packages.

#### `omf install` _`[<name>|<url>]`_

Install one _or more_ packages.

- You can install packages directly by URL via `omf install URL`
- When called without arguments, install missing packages from [bundle](#dotfiles).

#### `omf list`

List installed packages.

#### `omf theme` _`<theme>`_

Apply a theme. To list available themes type `omf theme`.

#### `omf remove` _`<name>`_

Remove a theme or package.

> Packages subscribed to `uninstall_<pkg>` events are notified before the package is removed, so custom cleanup of resources can be done. See [Uninstall](/docs/Packages.md#uninstall) for more information.

#### `omf new pkg | theme` _`<name>`_

Scaffold out a new package or theme.

> This creates a new directory under `$OMF_CONFIG/{pkg | themes}/` with a template.

#### `omf submit` _`pkg/<name>`_ _`[<url>]`_

Add a new package. To add a theme use `omf submit` _`themes/<name>`_ _`<url>`_.

Make sure to [send us a PR][omf-pulls-link] to update the registry.

#### `omf query` _`<variable name>`_

Use to inspect all session variables. Useful to  dump _path_ variables like `$fish_function_path`, `$fish_complete_path`, `$PATH`, etc.

#### `omf destroy`

Uninstall Oh My Fish.

# Advanced

Oh My Fish installer places its startup code in your fish config file (`~/.config/fish/config.fish`).

## Startup

Everytime you open a new shell the startup code initializes Oh My Fish installation path and the _config_ path (`~/.config/omf` by default), sourcing the [`init.fish`](init.fish) script afterwards, which autoload packages, themes and your custom init file. For more information check the [FAQ](docs/FAQ.md#what-does-oh-my-fish-do-exactly).

## Dotfiles

The `$OMF_CONFIG` directory represents the user state of Oh My Fish, and is the perfect
candidate for being added to your dotfiles and/or checked out to version control. There are two important files:

- __`theme`__ - The current theme
- __`bundle`__ - List of currently installed packages/themes

### About the bundle

Everytime a package/theme is installed or removed the `bundle` file is updated. You can also edit it manually and run `omf install` afterwards to satisfy the changes. Please note that while packages/themes added to the bundle gets automagically installed, a package/theme removed from bundle isn't removed from user installation.

## Creating Packages

Oh My Fish uses an advanced and well defined plugin architecture to ease plugin development, including init/uninstall events and function autoloading. [See the documentation](docs/Packages.md) for more details.
